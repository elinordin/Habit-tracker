### :scroll: Brief:
Build a habit tracker using vanilla JavaScript.


### :hourglass: Time spent:
3 weeks.


### :checkered_flag: Goals:
Learn how to work in groups with code, learn git, learn how to organize problems and break down tasks and also learn about storage.


### :heavy_check_mark: Solution:
We decided we wanted to give the user some sort of visual feedback when a goal was reached, which resulted in the concept ROTA. Every habit creates a plant and when a weekly-goal is reached that plant shall grow. We also wanted an overview page showing how far the user has left until deadline. Due to time we did not finish all features, so currently it's a daily tracker.
